### Understanding the Agent

You now see all the details around the agent:

- Walk through it to understand how it works
- It is **solely declarative**, so no additional data sources needed
- On the right, **test out the agent**

> **Note:** The standard campaign timeline starts on January 15th. If you are before this date, the agent might not uncover content during the conversation — but will give you options on how to start.

### Customizing the Agent

- You can **modify the campaign start date** within the agent's instructions
- Click **"Edit"** to do so
- Upload an agent icon — you'll find it in the repository or can use your own
  - Best size: **102 × 102 pixels**
- Then **save** the changes

*The agent is designed to keep up excitement for the kickoff date — if someone sneaks a peek before launch, no problem.*

### Awaiting Admin Approval
