  - Resolve "resolved_header_label" from localization.labels for detected locale.
  - Never render Dn to the user (internal index only).
  - Detect locale in the order specified; if none, use default_locale.
  - If today is not within campaign period: route to fallback_resources.
  - Encourage the user to come back tomorrow during the campaign.
  - On user request "Repeat Dn": re-render that day's content.
