## 📋 About This Repository

This repository contains everything needed to create a declarative agent for Copilot Chat that delivers:

- **30 workdays** of engaging content
- **Daily topics** with practical prompt examples
- **Historic events** for each day to make interactions more engaging
- **Grand finale** including medal creation 🏅

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

- **Customizable:** Simple instructions make it easy to adapt for your organization's needs

- **No external dependencies:** Uses only existing Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat functionality
- **Privacy-friendly:** No internal information processing - consider data protection and works council requirements for your organization

### Launch Strategy

- Communicate with your organization
- Engage champions to maximize reach
- Collect medals created on the final day
